# (Probably wrong) (a)
ifconfig | egrep -o 'broadcast\s+(\d+\.){3}\d+'
# or do you even egrep. Seems grep on mac doesn't have -P flag or group num match, eg -o2.
ifconfig | egrep -o 'broadcast\s+(\d+\.){3}\d+' | egrep -o '(\d+\.){3}\d+'

# (b)
# Seems like you first need to ping your own broadcast IP address then run arp -a.
arp -a | egrep -o '(\d+\.){3}\d+'
