dig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com | xargs dig -x
# Note that PTR records are not required for IP addresses. 
# If a PTR record is not defined for an IP address, you cannot do a reverse DNS lookup

# HOWEVER, you can query ipinfo.io with curl eg 
# dig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com | curl -s ipinfo.io | grep "org" | awk -F: '{print $2}'
# as a work around.
