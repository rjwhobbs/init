# Use the following command
whois slash16.org
# This will help give information about domains services the website uses.
# eg, we can see from the ouptut that their domain name is registered 
# with https://www.bookmyname.com . One will need to look for other 
# clues to see who s hosting their website, one can see from
# the name servers they are using that it is with AWS.

# Google will probably be a better place to get more info on the site 
# if needed but this is quick way to use on the terminal.
# Also note that these types of commands are not full proof, eg not all
# info is public, one may need to use a combination of commands
# and google searches.
