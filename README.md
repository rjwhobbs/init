# init
'Init' a sys admin project from the 42 curriculum 

'Init' is a project to help introduce one to the world of being a sys-admin
on linux based servers/machines.

Most of the commands and scripts found in this projects will often be used by 
sys-admins for daily debugging and maintenance. 

To really get a feel for working on an actaull server I suggest running the 
debian VM required for this project on a VM from a cloud provider.
Most of the cloud providers have free tier options and the VM costs are very little
provided you choose the appropriate size.

## Resources
First off I suggest taking a basic regex course. Some basic regex knowledge comes in real handy
when using command line tools like 'grep' for filtering command outputs.

Here are some of the online resources that I found helpful for finishing this project: <br/>
