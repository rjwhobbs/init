# Create the new user on the VM using 'sudo adduser <username>'.
# If you are using keys generate a new key on the local system, eg.
ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa
# Save the private key on the local machine
# Save the public key in the new user's /home/username/.ssh/authorized_keys file
# on the remote system.
# Besure to give the correct permissions during creation once done
# and then to give ownership of /home/username/.ssh/ to the new user
